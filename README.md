### Description

This repository was created to store R scripts that help to perform common procedures in Ecological Niche Modeling exercises. Scripts are organized according to the main activities that need to be done when creating ecological niche models (ENMs). See below for more detailed description.

<br>

### Data cleaning

Scripts in this section help to clean multiple types of errors that can be found in occurrence data sets. These errors decrease the quality of results obtained when creating ENMs and can lead to misleading conclusions; hence, data cleaning processes need to be done carefully and consciously.

All available scripts for performing data cleaning (cleaning of species occurrences) can be seen <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/ENM_manuals/tree/master/Data_cleaning" target="_blank">here</a>.

List of scripts in this section:

-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/ENM_manuals/blob/master/Data_cleaning/Occurrences_initial_corrections.R" target="_blank">Initial corrections to occurrence data</a>
-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/ENM_manuals/blob/master/Data_cleaning/Out_continents_or_M.R" target="_blank">Detection of occurrences outside of continents and the M</a>
-   <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/ENM_manuals/blob/master/Data_cleaning/Environmental_outlier_detection.R" target="_blank">Environmental outlier detection</a>

### Variables processing

To see all available scripts for processing environmental variables (predictors) that can be used in ENMs go to the following <a href="https://github.com/marlonecobos/ENM_manuals/tree/master/Variables_processing" target="_blank">link</a>.
